# A-journey-for-learning-advanced-tensorflow
**do you want to join me on TensorFlow journey?**

I have decided to follow Tensorflow in this repository in an advanced way. you will learn lots of informaion such as devoloping you own **layers**, **functions** and **models**.
also you will work with advanced computer vision techniques to implement reall world projects
lets have fun!
>1. functional API will free your hand to design model
>2. at the Multi_output.ipynb notebook you can see the model which support the multiple output. 
look at the bottom picture :

> 3. siamese network: 
> (t.ly/R6ga)
> 4. custom loss function: another important thing is that you can create  your own  loss function, at this repository you can see the structer and usage.
> 5. huber loss function : t.ly/nigp 
> 6. huber_object_loss: to avoid hard code the threshold argument you can turn the hubre loss function into a class
